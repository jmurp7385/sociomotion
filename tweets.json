Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn! It was great being with Luther Strange last night in Alabama. What great people, what a crowd! Vote Luther on Tuesday.

McCain let his best friend L.G. down! Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year, with deductibles very high. Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods.
